          <h5>Chapter I</h5>
          <div class="storyBody">
            <p>Our story begins in September 2010, when Maddie walked into Zingerman's Deli for her first shift. A food fanatic, Maddie was elated to be working in this long-loved food Mecca. She was paired up with David, who showed her around the deli, and the two were fast friends.</p>

            <p>They spent those first few months together making each other mixes, spending late nights watching silly videos and sharing stories, making the most of their time in Ann Arbor. By summer, they'd fallen in love.</p>
          </div>
          <h5>CHAPTER II</h5>
          <div class="storyBody">
            <p>The next few years were rich with new experiences, trips, adventures, hardships, and growth. They began to build a life together, moved into a small Kerrytown apartment, and created so many memories.</p>
            <img src="ChapterTwo.jpg" alt="A photo of Maddie and David on Mackinac Island.">
            <p>A few years after that, Maddie moved to Chicago and dove deeper into the culinary world. The fall after his graduation, David joined her, and they made a wonderful new home for themselves (complete with two cats).</p>

          <h5>CHAPTER III</h5>
          <div class="storyBody">
            <p>On a cold February day in 2017, Maddie and David took a drive to Madison for a weekend getaway. After a wintery lunch on Picnic Point, David took Maddie to the beautiful Arboretum. Deep in the woods, they reflected on the past six years together.</p>
            <img src="ChapterThree.jpg" alt="A photo of Maddie and David in Charlevoix, for the holidays.">
            <p>There, sharing the memories of the past and their hopes for the future, David asked Maddie to marry him, and she said yes! They laughed and danced practically all the way back to town, looking forward to the next adventure.</p>

          <p>We are so excited to get married in Three Oaks. It's our favorite place to get away and relax, so it seemed like the perfect place to celebrate with the people we love.</p>

          <p>The ceremony and reception will both take place at Journeyman Distillery, and some wonderful locals will be helping us put everything together.</p>
          <p>The wedding will be indoors in late summer, so we recommend comfortable, formal attire.</p>
